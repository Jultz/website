In Summer 2016, I did an internship at KM Individual, a small travel agency based in Cologne. Tis internship was part of my Bachelor's programme at Cologne Business School. As I was studying International Culture and Management, I decided to do my internship in a company where I would be actively engaging with people from different countries and cultures. Here, KMI fit perfectly. I was in contact with partner agencies from all over the world and was thus able to improve my intercultural skill and form an international mindset.
