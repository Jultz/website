Rodenstock is Germany's leading manufacturer of ophthalmic lenses and spectacle frames, headquartered in Munich. After my Bachelor's degree in International Culture and Management, I decided that I wanted to continue my career in the direction of Marketing. This is why I chose to do voluntary internship in this field.

During the internship, I was supporting the Global Marketing & Communications Department with a main focus on Professional Marketing and the Rodenstock Academy.
